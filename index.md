## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="website_image.jpg">

Hi! I am 1st year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I am co-supervised by [Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/profile/) and [Prof. Frank Rudzicz](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/). My research is focused on developing and interrogating machine learning models in safety-critical settings such as healthcare. I also work part-time as a Research Software Engineer at [Winterlight Labs](https://winterlightlabs.com/). I graduated from the [University of Toronto](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) with a Master's degree in Applied Computing in 2019. My master's project, generously supported by Winterlight Labs and a Mitacs Accelerate Scholarship, was supervised by [Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/profile/), [Prof. Frank Rudzicz](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/), and [Dr. Jekaterina Novikova](https://jeknov.tumblr.com/). Prior to this, I graduated with honors from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/eee/), India in 2017 where I was fortunate to get to work with [Prof. Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/). I have also held research intern positions at the Technische Universität, Dresden as a DAAD-WISE scholar in 2016 where I was supervised by [Prof. Carsten Rother](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/carsten-rother/) and [Prof. Stefan Gumhold](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/smt/cgv/die-professur/inhaber-in), and at the [Philips Innovation Campus, Bengaluru](https://www.philips.co.in/a-w/about-philips/philips-innovation-center.html) in the healthcare R&D team in 2017.

Here is my [CV](https://aparna-b.github.io/researcher/resume.pdf).

## Research Interests

Developing and understanding trustworthy machine learning and natural language processing techniques for healthcare
applications: particularly using unstructured and noisy human-generated data, with core machine learning methodologies
such as transfer learning and reinforcement learning.
