## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="website_image.jpg">

Hi! I am 4th year engineering student in the Department of Computer Science at the [SRM Institute of Science and Technology]( https://www.srmist.edu.in/). My research is focused on developing machine learning models in the healthcare sector. I have held research intern positions at [SPIHER]( https://spiher.ac.in/) Chennai in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Sikamani]( https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=_ftDrIQAAAAJ&hl=en)

Here is my [CV](https://vikramansen.github.io/resume.pdf).


## Research Interests

Developing and understanding machine learning to extract insights from digital data in high-impact domains, including healthcare. I am currently studying the challenges that arise from the application of deep learning to clinical data. 

## Current Project
- Jun. 2021 - Interspeech acceptance  \
Our paper ["Comparing Acoustic-based Approaches for Alzheimer's Disease Detection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01555) was accepted to Interspeech 2021!

- Dec. 2020 - DeepMind fellowship \
I received a DeepMind PhD Fellowship award.

- Nov. 2020 - Spotlight talk at the 6th Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text  \
I gave a spotlight talk at the 6th Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text at EMNLP 2020, presenting our work on the [impact of automatic speech recognition on Alzheimer's Disease detection from speech](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.wnut-1.21.pdf) 

- Jul. 2020 - Interspeech acceptance \
Our paper ["To BERT or Not To BERT: Comparing Speech and Language-based Approaches for Alzheimer's Disease Detection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01551) was accepted to Interspeech 2020!

## Announcements
1. This is my new website :)
2. I will be organising a new workshop on ML
