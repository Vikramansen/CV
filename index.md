Hi! I am master's student in the Computer Science at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu). I am actively researching methods to reduce hallucinations in large language models in collaboration with UC Davis Health. Previously, I interned as a software developer at Tata Communications Automation Division. Currently, I am seeking full-time opportunities starting Summer 2024.

Additionally, I love Racing and Soccer.

With my strong analytical and problem-solving skills, I have always been able to develop and deliver innovative solutions to challenging problems. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow, and am eager to be a part of a team that shares my passion for using technology to make a positive difference in the world.

# Projects

### LimitlessTales - A Fine-tuned GPT-2 Model for Story Generation:

• Utilized Transfer learning techniques to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom dataset of textual data to generate high-quality stories based on user input.

• Engineered an interactive front-end interface for users to seamlessly engage with the model, demonstrating its proficiency in adapting to diverse prompts and crafting cohesive narratives.

• Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS) and DALL·E capabilities, enhancing user immersion by providing auditory feedback and visual representations.

### Electronic Health Record System:

• Architected and developed a comprehensive EHR system using React.js, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface tailored for medical professionals and patients alike.

• Seamlessly integrated a robust document management module with Amazon S3 buckets for efficient and secure storage of patient images; optimized retrieval times while ensuring HIPAA-compliant encryption and data protection.
