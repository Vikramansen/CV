## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="website_image.jpg">

Hi! I am 4th year engineering student in the Department of Computer Science at the [SRM Institute of Science and Technology]( https://www.srmist.edu.in/). My research is focused on developing machine learning models in the healthcare sector. I have held research intern positions at [SPIHER]( https://spiher.ac.in/) Chennai in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Sikamani]( https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=_ftDrIQAAAAJ&hl=en)

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/Vikramansen/vikramansen.github.io/blob/gh-pages/resume.pdf).

## Research Interests

Developing and understanding machine learning to extract insights from digital data in high-impact domains, including healthcare. I am currently studying the challenges that arise from the application of deep learning to clinical data
